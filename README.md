# Vibe Backend API

A Node.js/Express backend for the Vibe nightlife app with PostgreSQL database, JWT authentication, and real-time venue data.

## Features

- üîê JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
- üè¢ Venue management with real-time occupancy tracking
- üìä Analytics and reporting for venue managers
- üéâ Deals, events, and posts management
- üîÑ Real-time busy status integration with SerpAPI and Google Places
- üì± RESTful API designed for mobile apps
- üõ°Ô∏è Security: Rate limiting, CORS, audit logging
- üì¶ Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

## Architecture

This backend follows the requirements from your architecture refactor:

### ‚úÖ Security & API Keys
- All API keys (SerpAPI, Google Places) are server-side only
- No sensitive data exposed to mobile clients
- JWT tokens stored securely in iOS Keychain

### ‚úÖ Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (USER, VENUE_MANAGER, ADMIN)
- Venue managers can only access their assigned venues
- Refresh token mechanism

### ‚úÖ Data Architecture
- PostgreSQL database with proper relations
- Prisma ORM for type safety
- Audit logging for all sensitive operations
- Real-time busy snapshots stored in database

### ‚úÖ API Design
- RESTful endpoints matching iOS app expectations
- Venue data served from database, not static files
- Aggregated analytics for venue managers
- Rate limiting and security middleware

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
cd VibeBackend
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL and API keys
```

3. Set up the database:
```bash
npm run generate  # Generate Prisma client
npm run migrate   # Run database migrations
```

4. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Environment Variables

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/vibe_db"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-here"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12

# API Keys (server-side only)
SERP_API_KEY="your-serp-api-key"
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="your-google-places-api-key"

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV="development"

# CORS Origins
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://app.vibe.com"
```

- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile

### Venues
- `GET /venues` - Get all venues (with filtering)
- `GET /venues/:id` - Get single venue details
- `GET /venues/:id/busy` - Get venue busy data/snapshots
- `GET /venues/:id/busy/aggregates` - Get aggregated busy analytics
- `POST /venues` - Create venue (Admin only)
- `PUT /venues/:id` - Update venue (Admin only)

### Venue Management (RBAC Protected)
- `POST /venues/:id/deals` - Create deal (Manager/Admin)
- `POST /venues/:id/events` - Create event (Manager/Admin)
- `POST /venues/:id/posts` - Create post (Manager/Admin)
- `GET /venues/:id/analytics/overview` - Get analytics (Manager/Admin)

### Feed
- `GET /feed` - Get personalized feed
- `GET /feed/trending` - Get trending content

### Users
- `PUT /users/me` - Update user profile
- `GET /users/me/activity` - Get user activity
- `DELETE /users/me` - Delete user account

## Database Schema

Key models:
- `User` - User accounts with RBAC
- `Venue` - Venue information and metadata
- `BusySnapshot` - Real-time occupancy data points
- `Deal` - Promotional deals
- `Event` - Venue events
- `Post` - User-generated content
- `AuditLog` - Security audit trail

## Security Features

### Rate Limiting
- Auth endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- Account creation: 3 requests per hour
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes

### Authentication
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Role-based access control
- Venue-specific access for managers

### Audit Logging
- All sensitive operations logged
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Sensitive data redaction

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run database migrations
4. Set up SSL/TLS certificates
5. Configure reverse proxy (nginx)
6. Set up monitoring and logging

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t vibe-backend .

# Run with database
docker-compose up -d
```

## API Integration with iOS

The iOS app should:

1. Set `baseURL` to your API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.vibe.app`)
2. Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in all requests
3. Handle token refresh when receiving 401 responses
4. Cache venue data with 5-minute expiry
5. Use the new endpoint structure:
   - `/venues` instead of static JSON files
   - `/venues/:id/busy` for real-time data
   - `/auth/*` for authentication

## Development

### Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run studio` - Open Prisma Studio
- `npm test` - Run tests
